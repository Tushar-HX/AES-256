# AES-256
This project is a Python-based desktop application that provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption. Built with Tkinter for the graphical user interface and the cryptography library for cryptographic operations, the tool allows users to select files, enter a password, and perform encryption or decryption with just a few clicks. The application uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and a randomly generated salt to derive a strong encryption key from the user's password, ensuring robust security. Files are encrypted using AES in CBC mode with a random initialization vector (IV), and both the salt and IV are stored at the beginning of the encrypted file for use during decryption. The program reads files in 1MB chunks to provide progress feedback via a progress bar, making it suitable for large files. Passwords must be at least 10 characters long to enhance security. The interface is divided into two sections for encryption and decryption, each with fields for password entry and file selection, as well as buttons to browse for files and start the process. Error handling and user notifications are managed through message boxes, ensuring a smooth user experience. Please note that the tool overwrites the original file during both encryption and decryption, so users should back up important data before use. This project is ideal for anyone seeking a straightforward, open-source solution for file encryption on Windows systems.
